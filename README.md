# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Projects
5 Projects from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program 

The Deep Learning nanodegree program consists of six parts: (1) Introduction to Deep Learning, (2) Neural Networks, (3) Convolutional Neural Networks, (4) Recurrent Neural Networks, (5) Generative Adversarial Networks, and (6) Deploying a Model. 


**Project 1:** [Prediciting Bike Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/mailology/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Project-1-Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns): In this project we build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.

**Project 2:** [Dog-Breed Classifier] In the project, we build a convolutional neural network that performs better than the average human in identifying dog breeds. Given an image of a dog, the CNN model will estimate the dog's breed. User experience of the app is considered in the design decisions on the app.

**Project 3:** [Generate TV Scripts] In this project, we build RNN and LSTM networks with PyTorch. We perform sentiment analysis to generate next text, and use recurrent networks to generate TV scripts.

**Project 4:** [Generate Faces] Learn and understand Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Implement a Deep Convolutional GAN which is made of a pair of multi-layer NN that compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic images of face.

**Project 5:** [Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model] In this project, we train and deploy a PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. This model will be trained to do sentiment analysis on movie reviews (positive or negative reviews). A gate is created to accessing this model from a website.
