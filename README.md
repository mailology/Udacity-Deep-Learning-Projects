# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Projects
5 Projects from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program 

The Deep Learning nanodegree program consists of six parts: (1) Introduction to Deep Learning, (2) Neural Networks, (3) Convolutional Neural Networks, (4) Recurrent Neural Networks, (5) Generative Adversarial Networks, and (6) Deploying a Model. 


**Project 1:** [Prediciting Bike Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/mailology/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Project-1-Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns): In this project we build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.

**Project 2:** [Dog-Breed Classifier]: In the project, we build a convolutional neural network that performs better than the average human in identifying dog breeds. Given an image of a dog, the CNN model will estimate the dog's breed. If supplied with an image of human, the code will also produce an estimate of the closet-resembling dog breed. User experience of the app is considered in the design decisions on the app.
