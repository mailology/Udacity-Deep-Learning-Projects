# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Projects
5 Projects from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program 

The Deep Learning nanodegree program consists of six parts: (1) Introduction to Deep Learning, (2) Neural Networks, (3) Convolutional Neural Networks, (4) Recurrent Neural Networks, (5) Generative Adversarial Networks, and (6) Deploying a Model. 


## Project 1: 
* [Prediciting Bike Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/mailology/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Project-1-Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns): In this project we build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.

## Project 2: Dog-Breed Classifier
